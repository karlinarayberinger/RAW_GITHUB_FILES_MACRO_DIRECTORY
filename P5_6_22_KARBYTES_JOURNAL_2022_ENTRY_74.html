<p>03_SEPTEMBER_2022: In order to (at least attempt to) put an end to an ongoing conflict I have been arguing with my selves about, I will say the following: the government interfering with my thoughts via <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_auditory_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microwave auditory effect</a> (and other mind control technologies) has done more to help me glean the most value out of my time, money, and energy than otherwise. Therefore, I have no valid reason to keep complaining about such interference.</p>
<p>The thought police and I seem to share at least one common goal: the goal to prevent me from behaving like a victim. I pride myself on not behaving like a victim (i.e. someone who complains incessantly while doing little to remedy whatever situations they are complaining about, someone who tries to exaggerate how badly they are being treated or are suffering in order to glean extra rewards, and, perhaps most importantly to me, someone who justifies retaliating to being offended in a manner which is at least as offensive and harmful as the initial offense was).</p>
<p>I think that I have some enemies who want me to play victim and to suffer more than I think is necessary. Such people may be more retribution driven than I am and have different priorities and cultural values than I have. Oh well. We still share the same planet. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I think it is in everyone&#8217;s best interest for me to minimize how much I intentionally try to make other people suffer even when other people go out of their way to make me suffer and to push me to the extent that I am arguably being forced to engage in retaliatory and harmful behavior.</span></p>
